          Paula Benton Dog Training is proud and deeply honored to partner with
          Veterinary Street Outreach Services (VET SOS) in helping people keep
          their pets. PBDT provides free animal training and behavior counseling
          at 12 VET SOS clinics annually throughout San Francisco. VET SOS is an
          innovative outreach project which addresses the unique problems of
          homeless individuals with companion animals. It is a project of the
          Street Outreach Services (SOS) program at the San Francisco Community
          Clinic Consortium (SFCCC). Services are provided by volunteer
          veterinarians and veterinary technicians through the use of a
          specially equipped mobile outreach van. VET SOS provides free: *
          veterinary exams * basic veterinary procedures * vaccinations *
          microchipping * referrals & transportation for free spay/neuter
          surgery * information about service animals in rental housing *
          information about responsible pet ownership * health care information
          & referrals to their homeless humans 12 mobile clinics are conducted
          in selected areas of San Francisco that are inhabited by homeless
          individuals with companion animals. VET SOS visits the Castro/Mission,
          China Basin, Golden Gate Park, Haight-Ashbury and Bayview-Hunter's
          Point neighborhoods. Additionally, they provide services at San
          Franciscoâ€™s Project Homeless Connect events as well as at the Homeless
          Youth Alliance. More than 6,500 homeless people were identified during
          San Francisco's 2009 biennial homeless count. VET SOS recognizes that
          keeping the pets of homeless people healthy sustains the physical and
          mental well-being of their human owners. Often, these pets serve as a
          sole source of emotional support, promote responsibility, and act as
          social catalysts for interactions with other people. By combining the
          efforts of animal health care providers and human health care
          providers to reach out to this often-wary population, VET SOS builds
          trust, enabling further outreach and education.
